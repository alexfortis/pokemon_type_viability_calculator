# Pokémon Type Viability Calculator
## Purpose
To algorithmically rank all Pokémon types from strongest to weakest based on how they interact with other types and the strength of Pokémon of other types.
## Methodology
- Scrape the data I need from wherever I can get it; [serebii.net](https://www.serebii.net) seems to have it.
- Data required: all moves of each type and category, all stats of all Pokémon (as of Generation 8).
- Follow the "in-depth" algorithm described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_m3Q1PCbKX0GMXKET2v3hJI8rQO4upwm_xi5xO2vU5Y/).
## Status
Defensive and offensive scores have been calculated. Check the rankings [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CchFpgJfxQf41MJu8qzS33wpiEW8g-63T_OSOu_cqrQ/).
